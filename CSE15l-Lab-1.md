## Part 2: Remotely Connecting
1. Download OpenSSH client from: [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)
2. Get your username, the username for everyone in CSE 15l is cs15lfa22## (the ## is your personal identifier), find it here: [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
3. Once at that link and you have your username, now we have to change your password (it automatically gives you a randomly assigned one)
4. Now that you've done all that open VSCode again and open the terminal and type in your user name followed by @ieng6.ucsd.edu so that it looks like: cs15lfa22##@ieng6.ucsd.edu
5. It should prompt you for your password, enter it (don't worry that it's not showing up, you're still typing it in)
6. After you've input your password it should look something like this:
